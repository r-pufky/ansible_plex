# Enable server support for IPv6? Default: True.
plex_enable_ipv6: true

# Use Secure connections?
#
# When enabled, some unencrypted connections (originating from the Media Server
# computer) will still be allowed and apps that don't support secure
# connections will not be able to connect at all.
#
# Values:
#    True: Required.
#   False: Preferred (default).
#
# Default: False.

# Custom certificate location.
#
# Absolute path to a PKCS #12 file containing a certificate and private key to
# enable TLS support on a custom domain.
#
# Default: ''.

# Custom certificate encryption key. Default: ''.

# Custom certificate domain.
#
# Domain name to be published to plex.tv using your mapped port; must match a

# Default: ''.

# Preferred network interface.
#
# The network interface local clients will use to connect.
#
# Values:
#   {ADAPTER}: Use specified location interface (e.g. enp4s0, etc).
#          '': Any network connection (default).
#
# Default: '' (any network connection).

# Use Strict TLS configuration?
#
# Disables legacy weak ciphers, increases DH group size, and switches to ECDSA
# certificates when renewing. May prevent older clients from connecting.

# Default: False.

# Enable local network discovery (GDM)?
#
# This enables the media server to discover other servers and players on the
# local network.

# Default: True.

# Remote streams allowed per user.
#
# Maximum number of simultaneous streams each user is allowed when not on the
# local network.

# LAN networks bandwidth enforcement.
#
# List of IP addresses or IP/netmask entries for networks that will be
# considered to be on the local network when enforcing bandwidth restrictions.
# If set, all other IP addresses will be considered to be on the external
# network and will be subject to external network bandwidth restrictions. If
# left blank, only the server's subnet is considered to be on the local
# network.

# Values:
#   {CIDR}: CIDR notation.

# Special Case:
#   0: No limit.
#
# Default: 0.

# Treat WAN IP as LAN bandwidth?
#
# Treat incoming requests from this network's WAN IP address as LAN requests in
# terms of bandwidth. This often occurs when DNS rebinding protection is in
# place and clients on the LAN cannot contact the server directly but instead
# have to go through the WAN IP address.
#
# Default: True.

# Enable Relay?
#
# Relay allows connections to the server through a proxy relay when the server
# is not accessible otherwise. Proxy relay is bandwidth limited.

# List of IP addresses and networks that are allowed without auth.
#
# List of IP addresses or IP/netmask entries for networks that are allowed to
# access Plex Media Server without logging in. When the server is signed out
# and this value is set, only localhost and addresses on this list will be
# allowed.
#
# Any app connecting to the server this way without being signed in will be
# treated as the admin/owner. That means access to all libraries as well as the
# ability to change server settings. We strongly encourage using Plex apps that
# allow signing in to accounts to ensure the highest security for your computer
# and network.
